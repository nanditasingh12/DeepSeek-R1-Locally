       "AIMessage(content=\"<think>\\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out who founded DeepSeek. I know it's a big company in the AI field, but I'm not sure where they got their name from or when they were formed. Let me think through this step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I remember that DeepSeek was acquired by another company called Rayo. I think the main reason for this acquisition was to expand into more industries and improve their services. So, Rayo must have been looking for a way to scale and diversify, which is why they bought DeepSeek.\\n\\nNow, where did Rayo come from? I know that Rayo AI was founded by Gao Yuzhen in 2019. He started the company as an AI expert who specializes in industrial AI and R&D. His background in AI makes him well-versed in developing intelligent systems for various industries.\\n\\nThe combination of Rayo's business strategy with DeepSeek's strengths must have been key to their acquisition. Rayo focused on research, innovation, and customer experience, which probably helped them stand out in the market and attract the right investors.\\n\\nDeepSeek itself was founded by Gao Yuzhen as well. He had a background in computer science and AI, which gave him the expertise needed to build this company. Their work included developing self-improvement systems for AI and creating a platform that integrated various AI tools into a unified ecosystem.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, Rayo AI was formed by Gao Yuzhen in 2019, and DeepSeek is Rayo's subsidiary. The acquisition happened because Rayo wanted to expand into more industries, and the strategic alignment of their businesses led to this successful purchase.\\n</think>\\n\\nDeepSeek was founded by Gao Yuzhen in 2019. He started his business as a leading AI company specializing in industrial AI and R&D. To further develop his expertise, he formed Rayo AI, which expanded into a global leader in AI research, innovation, and customer experience.\\n\\nRayo AI acquired DeepSeek with the strategic goal of scaling and diversifying its services to enhance market reach. The acquisition was driven by Rayo's desire to expand into more industries and improve their offerings.\\n\\nDeepSeek, founded by Gao Yuzhen, continues to leverage his expertise in computer science and AI to develop self-improvement systems for AI and integrate various tools into a unified ecosystem, ensuring its continued success.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'model': 'deepseek-r1:1.5b', 'created_at': '2025-02-05T16:26:07.3883565Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 36257105200, 'load_duration': 79457100, 'prompt_eval_count': 20, 'prompt_eval_duration': 675000000, 'eval_count': 496, 'eval_duration': 35501000000, 'message': Message(role='assistant', content='', images=None, tool_calls=None)}, id='run-2be17494-d52c-4d73-aec4-bc3769aaa243-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 20, 'output_tokens': 496, 'total_tokens': 516})"
